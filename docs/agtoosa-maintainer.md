# AgToosa Maintainer Guide

Use this guide when working on the AgToosa repository itself.

## When To Use This Mode

Use AgToosa maintainer mode for work that changes any of these surfaces:

- `agtoosa.sh` or `lib/*.sh`
- `template/` workflow files, prompts, agents, commands, or platform entry points
- release/version wiring tied to `AGTOOSA_VERSION`
- generator copy/update behavior
- bats coverage in `tests/agtoosa.bats`

Do not use this mode for ordinary feature work inside a generated project that merely happens to use AgToosa.

## Repository Facts

- AgToosa is a framework generator, not an SDK runtime.
- `agtoosa.sh` is the only supported entrypoint.
- `install.sh` is deprecated and should not be modified.
- `ship/` is temporary staging output and must never be treated as durable project state.
- The canonical version lives in `AGTOOSA_VERSION` at the top of `agtoosa.sh`.

## Operating Rules

1. Start from the concrete owning surface: the shell file, template file, or test that directly controls the behavior.
2. Keep diffs small and preserve the existing shell style: defensive quoting, `set -euo pipefail`, and ANSI color variables with `NC` resets.
3. If you change generator behavior, update or add targeted bats coverage in `tests/agtoosa.bats`.
4. If you change template file inventory or native AI wiring, keep file lists in `lib/config.sh` aligned.
5. If you change platform entry points under `template/`, keep them functionally equivalent across platforms unless the platform truly requires a different native format.
6. Never silently rely on version drift. If release behavior changes, inspect `CHANGELOG.md` and version wiring together.

## Working Loop

1. Identify the smallest behavior-owning file.
2. Form one falsifiable hypothesis about the requested behavior.
3. Make the smallest change that tests or implements that hypothesis.
4. Run the narrowest validation available.
5. Report what changed, how it was verified, and any remaining risk.

## Validation

- Prefer `bats tests/agtoosa.bats` when generator behavior or template installation changes.
- Use narrow `bash agtoosa.sh --help`, `--version`, `--list-template-files`, or `--update` checks when they directly cover the touched surface.
- For documentation-only or agent-config-only changes, verify that each native entry file points to this guide and that no frontmatter errors were introduced.

## Expected Output

- Brief findings or plan.
- Minimal set of changes.
- Exact validation performed.
- Open questions only if they block correctness.
