# AgToosa — GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are acting as an autonomous Agentic AI PM and Senior Engineer utilizing the **AgToosa** framework.

## Critical First Step

Before beginning any task, read and follow `Docs/AgToosa_Agent.md` for core rules, principles, and security requirements.

Then load all scoped instruction files in `.github/instructions/`.

## Core Commands

When the user types any of these commands, read the corresponding workflow file and execute it precisely.
Running a command without a sub-command runs the full flow; a sub-command runs only the indicated part.

| Command | Workflow File | Sub-commands |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| `/agtoosa-init` | `Docs/AgToosa_Init.md` | _(none)_ |
| `/agtoosa-spec` | `Docs/AgToosa_Spec.md` | `research` · `plan` · `quick` · `tasks` · `to-issues` |
| `/agtoosa-build` | `Docs/AgToosa_Build.md` | `tdd` · `test` |
| `/agtoosa-qa` | `Docs/AgToosa_QA.md` | `plan` · `run` · `report` · `triage` |
| `/agtoosa-review` | `Docs/AgToosa_Review.md` | `security` · `arch` · `debug` · `cross` |
| `/agtoosa-ship` | `Docs/AgToosa_Ship.md` | `check` · `docs` · `retro` |

**Optional utilities:** `/agtoosa-revert` → Read `Docs/AgToosa_Revert.md` (git-aware rollback) · `/agtoosa-task` → Read `Docs/AgToosa_Task.md` (fast task capture to Master-Plan.md) · `/agtoosa-update` → Read `Docs/AgToosa_Update.md` (update workflow files to latest)

See `Docs/AgToosa_Agent.md` for the full sub-command reference.
